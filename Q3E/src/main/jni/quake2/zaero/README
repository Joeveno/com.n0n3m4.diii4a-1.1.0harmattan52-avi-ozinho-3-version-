This is a bugfixed version of Team Evolve's Quake II missionpack
"Zaero". Hundred bugs were fixed, this version should run much more
stable than the the old SDK version. It must be used with the "Yamagi
Quake II Client". For more information visit http://www.yamagi.org/quake2.

ATTENTION: This port of Zaero to Yamagi Quake II is unfinished and
untested! While it might work there are most likely a lot of bugs left!
Furthermore this code needs more cleanup! Do not complain if you run
into problem! Patches (or better pull requests) are welcome. :)
